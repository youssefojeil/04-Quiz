# 04-Quiz
A two page quiz web app with Leaderboards.

## Description

This website was created as an intro to programming quiz using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. Knowledge in traversing & manipulating the DOM, Objects, local storage, event listeners & multiple JS & HTML files were required to complete the challenge. Learned how powerful it is to use event listeners and triggers that run when user does something on a website. Learned how to use two pages running different scripts with different functions and how to manipulate the DOM to meet my web app's requirements.
